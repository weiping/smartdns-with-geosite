# Geosite Implementation in SmartDNS

The `domain-set` configuration option in `smartdns.conf` supports `geosite` as a valid type. This allows for the use of geosite data files to define sets of domains.

## Example Configuration

Here is an example of how to configure a `domain-set` with the type `geosite` in your `smartdns.conf` file:

```
domain-set -n my-geosite-rules -t geosite -f /path/to/geosite-file.txt
```

### Explanation

- `domain-set`: This is the command to define a new domain set.
- `-n my-geosite-rules`: This flag specifies the name of the domain set. In this example, the name is `my-geosite-rules`.
- `-t geosite`: This flag indicates the type of the domain set. Here, `geosite` signifies that the domain set will be populated based on a geosite data file.
- `-f /path/to/geosite-file.txt`: This flag specifies the absolute path to the file containing the geosite data. SmartDNS will read this file to load the domain rules associated with this set.

This configuration defines a domain set named `my-geosite-rules`, identifies its type as `geosite`, and points to `/path/to/geosite-file.txt` as the source of the geosite data. This allows for flexible and powerful domain-based routing and filtering based on geographic or categorical classifications typically found in geosite files.

## Geosite Data Loading

The loading of geosite data is handled by the `_config_domain_rule_set_each` function, which can be found in the `src/dns_conf.c` file. This function is responsible for processing all `domain-set` entries defined in the `smartdns.conf` configuration file.

When SmartDNS parses the configuration and encounters a `domain-set` entry, it calls `_config_domain_rule_set_each` with the name of the domain set. This function then retrieves the details of the named domain set, including its type and associated file path.

The core logic for handling different types of domain sets resides in a `switch` statement within this function. If the `domain-set` is of type `geosite`, the control flow is directed to the `DNS_DOMAIN_SET_GEOSITE` case.

Here is a snippet of the `_config_domain_rule_set_each` function, illustrating the handling of different domain set types:

```c
static int _config_domain_rule_set_each(const char *domain_set, set_rule_add_func callback, void *priv)
{
	struct dns_domain_set_name_list *set_name_list = NULL;
	struct dns_domain_set_name *set_name_item = NULL;

	set_name_list = _config_get_domain_set_name_list(domain_set);
	if (set_name_list == NULL) {
		tlog(TLOG_WARN, "domain set %s not found.", domain_set);
		return -1;
	}

	list_for_each_entry(set_name_item, &set_name_list->set_name_list, list)
	{
		switch (set_name_item->type) {
		case DNS_DOMAIN_SET_LIST:
			if (_config_set_rule_each_from_list(set_name_item->file, callback, priv) != 0) {
				return -1;
			}
			break;
		case DNS_DOMAIN_SET_GEOSITE:
			// Logic for geosite data processing would be here
			break;
		default:
			tlog(TLOG_WARN, "domain set %s type %d not support.", set_name_list->name, set_name_item->type);
			break;
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
```

When a `domain-set` configured with type `geosite` (e.g., `domain-set -n my-geosite-rules -t geosite ...`) is processed, the `set_name_item->type` will correspond to `DNS_DOMAIN_SET_GEOSITE`. The `switch` statement will then execute the code block associated with this case, which is where the specific logic for reading and interpreting the geosite data file would be implemented. Currently, the snippet shows a placeholder comment where this logic would reside.

## Missing Implementation

It is important to note that the `case DNS_DOMAIN_SET_GEOSITE:` within the `_config_domain_rule_set_each` function in `src/dns_conf.c` is currently empty. As shown in the code snippet above, the block for `DNS_DOMAIN_SET_GEOSITE` only contains a comment: `// Logic for geosite data processing would be here`.

This means that while `geosite` is a recognized `domain-set` type by the configuration parser, the actual functionality to read the specified file (e.g., `/path/to/geosite-file.txt` from the example) and process its contents (e.g., parsing geosite rules and populating the domain set) is not yet implemented in the codebase.

Therefore, if a user configures a `domain-set` with type `geosite`, SmartDNS will acknowledge the configuration type, but it will not perform any actions to load or apply the rules from the geosite file. The domains specified in such a file will not be part of any DNS resolution logic. The code acknowledges the type but does not act on it.

## Potential Use Cases

Geosite databases typically contain lists of domain names or IP addresses categorized by their geographical location (e.g., country, region) or by other attributes (e.g., "advertisement", "malware"). If the `geosite` functionality were fully implemented in SmartDNS, this data could be utilized in several powerful ways:

- **GeoDNS:** By understanding the geographical location associated with certain domains or IP addresses (and potentially the location of the querying client), SmartDNS could resolve domain names to different IP addresses. This would direct clients to the nearest or most optimal server, improving performance and user experience.
- **Content Localization:** Geosite data could be used to serve different content or redirect users to different versions of a website based on their region, providing a more tailored experience.
- **Access Control:** It would be possible to restrict or allow access to certain domains or services based on the geographical origin of the request or the destination. For example, blocking access to services known to be malicious in certain regions, or allowing access only from specific countries.
- **Traffic Shaping/Analytics:** DNS queries and traffic could be categorized by region or other geosite attributes. This would enable more detailed analytics and allow for the application of region-specific routing rules or policies, such as sending DNS queries for a specific country's domains to a particular upstream DNS server.

These are just a few examples, and the actual utility would depend on the specific implementation and the richness of the geosite data files used. However, the core idea is to leverage geographical and categorical domain/IP information to make DNS resolution more intelligent and context-aware.
